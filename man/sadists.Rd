\section{Sum of (non-central) chi-square to powers}{


Let \eqn{X_i \sim \chi^2\left(\delta_i, \nu_i\right)}{X_i ~ chi^2(delta_i, v_i)}
be independently distributed non-central chi-squares, where \eqn{\nu_i}{v_i}
are the degrees of freedom, and \eqn{\delta_i}{delta_i} are the
non-centrality parameters.  
Let \eqn{w_i} and \eqn{p_i} be given constants. Suppose
\deqn{Y = \sum_i w_i X_i^{p_i}.}{Y = sum w_i (X_i)^(p_i).}
Then \eqn{Y}{Y} follows a weighted sum of chi-squares to power distribution. 
The special case where all the \eqn{p_i}{p_i} are one is a 'sum of
chi-squares' distribution; 
The special case where all the \eqn{p_i}{p_i} are one half is a 'sum of
chis' distribution;
}

\section{Lambda Prime}{


Introduced by Lecoutre, the lambda prime distribution
finds use in inference on the Sharpe ratio under normal
returns.
Suppose \eqn{y \sim \chi^2\left(\nu\right)}{y ~ x^2(v)}, and
\eqn{Z}{Z} is a standard normal. 
\deqn{T = Z + t \sqrt{y/\nu}}{T = Z + t sqrt(y/v)}
takes a lambda prime distribution with parameters 
\eqn{\nu, t}{v, t}.
A lambda prime random variable can be viewed as a confidence
variable on a non-central t because 
\deqn{t = \frac{Z' + T}{\sqrt{y/\nu}}}{t = (Z' + T)/sqrt(y/v)}
}

\section{Upsilon}{


The upsilon distribution generalizes the lambda prime to the
case of the sum of multiple chi variables. That is,
suppose \eqn{y_i \sim \chi^2\left(\nu_i\right)}{y_i ~ x^2(v_i)}
independently and independently of \eqn{Z}{Z}, a standard normal. 
Then 
\deqn{T = Z + \sum_i t_i \sqrt{y_i/\nu_i}}{T = Z + sum_i t_i sqrt(y_i/v_i)}
takes an upsilon distribution with parameter vectors
\eqn{[\nu_1, \nu_2, \ldots, \nu_k]', [t_1, t_2, ..., t_k]'}{<v_1, v_2, ..., v_k>, <t_1, t_2, ..., t_k>}.

The upsilon distribution is used in certain tests of
the Sharpe ratio for independent observations.
}

\section{K Prime}{


Introduced by Lecoutre, the K prime family of distributions generalize
the (singly) non-central t, and lambda prime distributions. 
Suppose \eqn{y \sim \chi^2\left(\nu_1\right)}{y ~ x^2(v1)}, and
\eqn{x \sim t \left(\nu_2, a\sqrt{y/\nu_1}/b\right)}{x ~ t(v2,(a/b) sqrt(y/v1))}.
Then the random variable
\deqn{T = b x}{T = b x}
takes a K prime distribution with parameters 
\eqn{\nu_1, \nu_2, a, b}{v1, v2, a, b}. In Lecoutre's terminology,
\eqn{T \sim K'_{\nu_1, \nu_2}\left(a, b\right)}{T ~ K'_v1,v2(a,b)}

Equivalently, we can think of
\deqn{T = \frac{b Z + a \sqrt{\chi^2_{\nu_1} / \nu_1}}{\sqrt{\chi^2_{\nu_2} / \nu_2}}}{T = (bZ + a sqrt(chi2_v1/v1)) / sqrt(chi2_v2/v2)}
where \eqn{Z} is a standard normal, and the normal and the (central) chi-squares are
independent of each other. When \eqn{a=0}{a=0} we recover
a central t distribution; 
when \eqn{\nu_1=\infty}{v1=inf} we recover a rescaled non-central t distribution;
when \eqn{b=0}{b=0}, we get a rescaled square root of a central F
distribution; when \eqn{\nu_2=\infty}{v2=inf}, we recover a 
Lambda prime distribution.
}

\section{Doubly Noncentral t}{


The doubly noncentral t distribution generalizes the (singly)
noncentral t distribution to the case where the numerator is
the square root of a scaled noncentral chi-square distribution.
That is, if 
\eqn{X \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu,1\right)}{X ~ N(u,1)} independently
of \eqn{Y \sim \chi^2\left(k,\theta\right)}{Y ~ x^2(k,theta)}, then
the random variable
\deqn{T = \frac{X}{\sqrt{Y/k}}}{T = X / sqrt(Y/k)}
takes a doubly non-central t distribution with parameters
\eqn{k, \mu, \theta}{k, mu, theta}.
}

\section{Doubly Noncentral F}{


The doubly noncentral F distribution generalizes the (singly)
noncentral F distribution to the case where the numerator is
a scaled noncentral chi-square distribution.
That is, if 
\eqn{X \sim \chi^2\left(n_1,\theta_1\right)}{X ~ x^2(n1,theta1)} independently 
of \eqn{Y \sim \chi^2\left(n_2,\theta_2\right)}{Y ~ x^2(n2,theta2)}, then
the random variable
\deqn{T = \frac{X / n_1}{Y / n_2}}{T = (X/n1) / (Y/n2)}
takes a doubly non-central F distribution with parameters
\eqn{n_1, n_2, \theta_1, \theta_2}{n1, n2, theta1, theta2}.
}

\section{Parameter recycling}{


It should be noted that the functions provided by sadists do \emph{not}
recycle their distribution parameters against the 
\code{x, p, q} or \code{n} parameters. This is in contrast to the 
common R idiom, and may cause some confusion. This is mostly for reasons
of performance, but also because some of the distributions have vector-valued
parameters; recycling over these would require the user to provide \emph{lists}
of parameters, which would be unpleasant.
